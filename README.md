# Task One

The following is the task which was set for Task 1:
The Collatz conjecture is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics.  The problem is to prove that if you start with any positive integer $x$ and repeatedly apply the function $f(x)$ below, you always get stuck in the repeating sequence 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2,...,
Your task is to verify, using Python, that the conjecture is true for the first 10000 positive integers.

Task One has now been completed and added to the repository. (The day has been spent reviewing lectures and online sources, more content to be added to this section shortly)

Research (25%): evidence of research on topics; appropriate referencing; building on work of others; comparison to similar work.

Development (25%): clear, concise, and correct code; appropriate tests; demonstrable knowledge of different approaches and algorithms; clean architecture.

Documentation (25%): clear explanations of concepts in notebooks; concise comments in code and elsewhere; appropriate, standard README for a GitHub repository.

Consistency (25%): tens of commits, each representing a reasonable amount of work; literature, documentation, and code evidencing work on the assessment; evidence of reviewing and refactoring.

# Task Two

Give an overview of the famous penguins data set, explaining the types of variables it contains. Suggest the types of variables that should be used to model them in Python, explaining your rationale.
